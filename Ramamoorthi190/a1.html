		<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
		<h2>3.2 Basic Operations</h2>
		<h4>Image::Brighten</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -brightness
			&lt;val&gt;</span>.
			This was implemented by scaling each color of each pixel by the given
			amount, clamping the values to remain within the range [0, 255].
			Example given below:
		</p>
		<img src='bright_img.bmp'/><img src='dullshed.bmp'/><br/>The image on the
		left was calculated using a brightness factor of 2.4. The right image used
		0.4.
		<h4>Image::ChangeContrast</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -contrast
			&lt;val&gt;</span>. This was implemented by first calculating the average
			luminance of the image, followed by linearly interpolating between each
			pixel color and that average luminance. Example given below:
		</p>
		<img src='negwave.bmp'/><img src='conwave.bmp'/><img src='midwave.bmp'/><br/>The left image was
		calculated using a contrast value of -1.3; the center image was calculated
		with 2.5; the right image was calculated with 0.3.
		<h4>Image::ChangeSaturation</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -saturation
			&lt;val&gt;</span>.
			This was implemented by linearly interpolating each pixel with a
			greyscale version of itself, clamping values to legal ranges. Examples
			given below:
		</p>
		<img src='satman.bmp'/><img src='satman2.bmp'/><br/>
		The left image was generated using a saturation value of 2; the right was
		generated with 0.2.
		<h4>Image::ChangeGamma</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -gamma
			&lt;val&gt;</span>. This was implemented by converting the discrete color
			values into the continuous range [0, 1), and then raising them to the
			inverse of the value provided. Examples provided below:
		</p>
		<img src='lowgamflower.bmp'/><img src='midgamflower.bmp'/><img
		src='highgamflower.bmp'/><br/>
		The left image used a value of 0.5; the middle is 1; the right is 2.
		<h4>Image::Crop</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -crop &lt;x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;</span>.
			This is done by creating a new image and dropping the unused pixels. This
			allows a photo from an old CSE 167 assignment revealing a bug to have the
			bug conveniently removed, as such:
		</p>
		<img src='cropbots.bmp'/><img src='cropbots2.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left reveals the bug; the image on the right hides it.
