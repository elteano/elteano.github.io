		<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
		<h2>3.2 Basic Operations</h2>
		<h4>Image::Brighten</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -brightness
			&lt;val&gt;</span>.
			This was implemented by scaling each color of each pixel by the given
			amount, clamping the values to remain within the range [0, 255].
			Example given below:
		</p>
		<img src='bright_img.bmp'/><img src='dullshed.bmp'/><br/>The image on the
		left was calculated using a brightness factor of 2.4. The right image used
		0.4.
		<h4>Image::ChangeContrast</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -contrast
			&lt;val&gt;</span>. This was implemented by first calculating the average
			luminance of the image, followed by linearly interpolating between each
			pixel color and that average luminance. Example given below:
		</p>
		<img src='negwave.bmp'/><img src='conwave.bmp'/><img src='midwave.bmp'/><br/>The left image was
		calculated using a contrast value of -1.3; the center image was calculated
		with 2.5; the right image was calculated with 0.3.
		<h4>Image::ChangeSaturation</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -saturation
			&lt;val&gt;</span>.
			This was implemented by linearly interpolating each pixel with a
			greyscale version of itself, clamping values to legal ranges. Examples
			given below:
		</p>
		<img src='satman.bmp'/><img src='satman2.bmp'/><br/>
		The left image was generated using a saturation value of 2; the right was
		generated with 0.2.
		<h4>Image::ChangeGamma</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -gamma
			&lt;val&gt;</span>. This was implemented by converting the discrete color
			values into the continuous range [0, 1), and then raising them to the
			inverse of the value provided. Examples provided below:
		</p>
		<img src='lowgamflower.bmp'/><img src='midgamflower.bmp'/><img
		src='highgamflower.bmp'/><br/>
		The left image used a value of 0.5; the middle is 1; the right is 2.
		<h4>Image::Crop</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -crop &lt;x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;</span>.
			This is done by creating a new image and dropping the unused pixels. This
			allows a photo from an old CSE 167 assignment revealing a bug to have the
			bug conveniently removed, as such:
		</p>
		<img src='cropbots.bmp'/><img src='cropbots2.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left reveals the bug; the image on the right hides it.
		<h2>3.3 Quantization and Dithering</h2>
		<h4>Image::Quantize</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -quantize
			&lt;nbits&gt;</span>. This works by first reducing each pixel to the
			constraints given, then inflating that value back into the [0, 255] range
			expected in the bitmap. Examples are given below:
		</p>
		<img src='house_2.bmp'/><img src='house_4.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left is quantized to 2 bits; the image on the right is
		quantized to 4.
		<h4>Image::RandomDither</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -randomDither
			&lt;bits&gt;</span>. This works by adding noise to the image prior to
			quantizing with the hope that this will reduce the sharp contours created
			by quantizing. Examples are given below:
		</p>
		<img src='randhouse_2.bmp'/><img src='randhouse_4.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left is quantized with random dither to 2 bits; the image
		on the right is quantized with random dither to 4 bits.
		<h4>Image::FloydSteinbergDither</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -FloydSteinbergDither
			&lt;bits&gt;</span>. This works by spreading the error created through
			quantization to neighboring pixels, with the intent that the result will
			be seen by users as similarly colored to the original. Examples are given
			below:
		</p>
		<img src='fhouse_2.bmp'/><img src='fhouse_4.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left is quantized with Floyd-Steinberg dither to 2 bits;
		the image on the right is similarly quantized to 4 bits. Note that while
		the quantization is harder to see due to the error spreading and the
		shrunken image, the fault
		lines created by a substandard implementation are quite visible.
		<h2>3.4 Basic Convolution and Edge Detection</h2>
		<h4>Image::Blur</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -blur &lt;n&gt;</span>.
			First, pixel weights are calculated in a single dimension along the
			Gaussian curve. This is then expanded to create a Gaussian matrix in two
			dimensions, and then fed through a convolution function. Examples are
			shown below:
		</p>
		<img src='blurflower.bmp'/><img src='megablurflower.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left was blurred with a matrix size of 3; the image on the
		right was blurred with a matrix size of 13.
		<h4>Image::Sharpen</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -sharpen</span>.
			The sharpness amount is hardcoded; a 3x3 convolution matrix is utilized
			which gives heavy weight to the center pixel and negative weights to its
			neighbors. Examples are shown below:
		</p>
		<img src='unsharpmonkey.bmp'/><img src='sharpmonkey.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left is the image prior to modification; the image on the
		right has been sharpened. Notice the increased definition of its fur and
		nose features.
		<h4>Image::EdgeDetect</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image -edgeDetect
			&lt;threshold&gt;</span>.
			This uses a Sobel filter which is passed through a convolution function
			in order to detect gradients. The gradients are then sent through a sieve
			which uses the provided threshold to determine the gradient speed
			required to count as an edge. Examples are shown below:
		</p>
		<img src='baseflower.bmp'/><img src='floweredge50.bmp'/><img
		src='floweredge125.bmp'/><br/>
		The image on the left is the base image used. The center image has a
		threshold of 50; the right image has a threshold of 125.
		<h2>3.5 Antialiased Scale and Shift</h2>
		<h4>Image::Scale</h4>
		<p>
			This may be run through <span class='mono'>image [-sampling &lt;num&gt;] -size &lt;x&gt;
			&lt;y&gt;</span>, with valid sampling numbers
			being 0 for nearest neighbor and 1 for hat. The respective filter is
			first applied along the x axis for stetching / shrinking, and then along
			the y axis for the appropriate operation. Mitchell filter had a
			late-emerging bug which has prevented its inclusion entirely; hat filter
			also had a similarly late-emerging bug, although it is still vaguely presentable.
			Examples are given below:
		</p>
		<img src='nstretchwave.bmp' style='width:600;height:400'/><img
		src='nshrinkwave.bmp' style='width:300;height:200'/><img
		src='nstickwave.bmp' style='width:200;height:400'/><br/>
		The image on the left has been expanded; the image in the center has been
		shurnk; and the image on the right has been squished (nearest neighbor).
		<img src='hstretchwave.bmp' style='width:600;height:400'/><img
		src='hshrinkwave.bmp' style='width:300;height:200'/><img
		src='hstickwave.bmp' style='width:200;height:400'/><br/>
		The image on the left has been expanded; the image in the center has been
		shurnk; and the image on the right has been squished (hat). Notice that
		there is a bug.
		<h4>Image::Shift</h4>
		<p>
			This was not implemented... sadness fills the land.
