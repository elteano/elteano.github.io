			CSE 190, Advanced Graphics
		</h1>
		<p>
			This course was taken in the winter quarter of 2016 at UCSD under
			professor Ravi Ramamoorthi.
		</p>
		<p>
			This course had three assignments, for which the writeups are hosted here.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href='a1.html'>Assignment 1</a><br/>
			This assignment focused on image processing. A few basic filters were
			implemented, as well as various scaling operations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href='a2.html'>Assignment 2</a><br/>
			This assignment focused progressive meshes. The number of vertices in the
			meshes is decimated, and the lost vertex information is stored so that the
			mesh may be later reconstructed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href='a3.html'>Assignment 3</a><br/>
			This assignment was left open, and so I decided to implement the Image
			Analogies algorithm.
