		<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
		<p>
			For this assignment, I will be implementing the Image Analogies algorithm
			as discussed in the paper available <a
			href='http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-fullres.pdf'>here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			My work thus far has been purely on the framework for reading and writing
			image data. I am still working on understanding the paper linked above. Most specifically, I
			am confused about the nature of a &#8216;Gaussian pyramid&#8217;, which
			consists of the first step in the Image Analogies algorithm as well as
			the basis for all of the following steps. I intend to meet with the
			professor this following week on the topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			My understanding of the Gaussian Pyramid is limited, although I believe
			that I will be able to reuse some code from A1, as it involves repeated
			convolutions using a Gaussian blur and minifications. However, I am
			uncertain as to whether the Gaussian blur is actually applied or if the
			minifications use a Gaussian-weighted average in calculating the new
			pixels.
		</p>
			My final report will include the details of my implementation along with
			cost analysis of the algorithms involved and examples generated by my
			implementation. It will also mention which features were used in order to
			synthesize the examples as well as the base image and training pair.
