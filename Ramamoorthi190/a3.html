		<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
		<p>
			For this assignment, I will be implementing the Image Analogies algorithm
			as discussed in the paper available <a
			href='http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-fullres.pdf'>here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			My work thus far has been purely on the framework for reading and writing
			image data and understanding the paper linked above. Most specifically, I
			am confused about the nature of a &#8216;Gaussian pyramid&#8217;, which
			consists of the first step in the Image Analogies algorithm as well as
			the basis for all of the following steps. I intend to meet with the
			professor this following week on the topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			My final report will include the details of my implementation along with
			cost analysis of the algorithms involved and examples generated by my
			implementation.
