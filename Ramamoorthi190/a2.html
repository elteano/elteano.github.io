		<h1>Assignment 2</h1>

		<p>
			The program for this assignment may be downloaded <a
			href='a2/a2.zip'>here</a>. Note that this uses SDL2, and needs the
			corresponding DLL to be in an accessible directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program is executed as <span class='mono'>a2 &lt;file&gt;
			[&lt;threshold&gt;]</span>. If no threshold is specified, a default of
			edge-based adjacency will be used. Note that calculating adjacency with
			thresholds will incur a significant startup cost.
		</p>

		<h2>3.1 Mesh Viewer</h2>

		<p>
			The mesh viewer implemented for this is very simplistic, using only the
			fixed function pipeline and no performance optimizations to enable easier
			manipulation of the mesh data. Thus, for detailed meshes, expect there to
			be some visual lag until the mesh has been reduced.
		</p>
		<p>
			The view may be rotated with a left click and drag. The trackball
			rotation calculation was pulled from a previous CSE 167 assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The view may be panned with a right click and drag.
		</p>
		<p>
			The view may be zoomed using the mouse wheel.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to enable debug colors, hit the 'd' key. This will enable a sort
			of gemstone appearance, in which each vertex of each face has a different
			color value (however, this will not be the same color for the same vertex
			in multiple faces). The default view is shaded based on the normals
			calculated based on face orientation. Note that there is an unexpected
			which will cause the color of the model to no longer be grey after
			toggling debug view.
		</p>

		<h2>3.2 Mesh Data Structure</h2>

		<p>
			The data structure used was an indexed vertex list coupled with a face
			list. Each vertex in the vertex list maintains a list of the faces of
			which the vertex is a part, and this allows the vertices to keep track of
			their neighbors.
		</p>
		<p>
			This structure was selected due to the simplicity of implementation. This
			is the most convenient structure to send to OpenGL, and so using this
			structure minimizes the amount of transformation required in order to
			display the data. It is also reasonably efficient for edge collapses;
			these are implemented by replacing the first of the two vertices with the
			new vertex, thus maintaining that index, and then replacing the
			references to the second vertex with the index for the first, thus
			preventing the need to correct indices for all subsequent vertices and
			simplifying the progressive mesh process. Thus, this remains a O(f)
			process, where f is the number of faces involved with the second vertex.
			The faces are combined by adding them to a red-black tree in order to
			prevent duplicates, which is then converted back to an array when all
			faces in the merge have been processed. This brings the data structure
			merge to an O(f log(f)) process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating the data structure is very straightforward. As each vertex line
			is read, the data is parsed and the vertex is placed into the vertex
			list. The faces are then read in the same manner, with each vertex given
			a reference to any faces which contain it. As faces are being read, data
			is aggregated for calculating the normals. After all the faces are read,
			the data is then normalized and the normals are assigned to the
			appropriate vertices. After this, the error matrices are calculated for
			each vertex, the model is scaled and centered, and the connecting pairs
			are determined.
		</p>
		<h2>3.3 Mesh Decimation</h2>
		<p>
			Mesh decimation is mostly described above. One thing to note is that
			degenerate faces are not discarded from the data structure, but are
			instead marked as invalid; when drawing the model, the program checks
			each face for validity before attempting to draw it. The idea behind this
			was that this would make the progressive mesh more straighforward, as the
			face does not need to be reconstructed, but instead just marked as valid
			again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simple edge collapse may be done manually by hitting the 'e' key, typing
			the index of the first vertex followed by the enter key, and then typing
			the index of the second vertex followed by the enter key. This will
			combine the vertices to the midpoint; in order combine to first vertex as
			displayed below, the code was temporarily modified. After the 'e' key is
			hit, a prompt will be displayed to the command prompt (if available);
			note that the graphic window must be selected in order to have your input
			understood by the program.
		</p>

		The image on the left is the unmodified plane. The image in the center is
		the plane modified so that vertices 11 and 23 are combined to the location
		of vertex 11. The plane on the right is modified so that vertices 11 and 23
		are combined to the midpoint.
		<h2>3.4 Quadric Simplification</h2>
		<p>
			A heap was implemented in order to perform the simplification. Each
			vertex keeps a record of the pairs of which it is a part, and each pair
			keeps a record of where it lies in the heap. This allows pairs to rapidly
			be accessed, modified, and re-sorted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quadric simplification is controlled through the 'x' and 'c' keys. The
			'x' key will remove a single vertex and report the number of milliseconds
			required to do so. The 'c' key will reduce the mesh to 10% of its
			original vertices and report the time required to do so in seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Optimal vertices are calculated. However, this is not a perfect
			implementation, as can be seen below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pictured below is the elephant model before and after decimation (reduced
			to 10% of its original vertices). This process took about 71 seconds,
			tracked by the program.

		trunk and face.<br/>

		The image on the left is the elephant prior to decimation. The image on the
		right is the elephant after decimation. Notice the shading artifacts
		created during the decimation process as well as the chunk taken out of the
		elephant's ear.
		<p>
			Difficulties with this portion arose mostly due to simple errors which
			had profound effects - adding instead of multiplying in the matrix *
			vertex implementation and neglecting to dereference pair pointers were
			two small errors which took quite a bit of time to locate.
