      Here's an overview of some of the work I've done...

      Final project, a collaboration with my peer Marco Mendez. I personally
      created the bloom effects and the water effects.

      The bloom effects are implemented using a Gaussian blur over the highlights
      of the scene. First, the items are rendered as normal; they are then
      filtered for the highlights, which are extracted into a separate
      framebuffer. The highlights are then flipped back and forth between two
      framebuffers, each time blurring either on the horizontal or vertical axes.
