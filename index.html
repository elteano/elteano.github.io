    <p>
      Welcome to my humble web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's an overview of some of the work I've done...
    </p>

    <h2>Graphics</h2>
    <h3>
      CSE 167 at UCSD:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Final project, a collaboration with my peer Marco Mendez. I personally
      created the bloom effects and the water effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bloom effects are implemented using a Gaussian blur over the highlights
      of the scene. First, the items are rendered as normal; they are then
      filtered for the highlights, which are extracted into a separate
      framebuffer. The highlights are then flipped back and forth between two
      framebuffers, each time blurring either on the horizontal or vertical axes.

			CSE 190 at UCSD

			There were three assignments for this course. For more information, follow

    <h3>D Language Wrappers</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a personal fan of this language, and so I've been working to create
      some SDL-based wrappers for OpenGL (as well as various SDL constructs).
      This can be found <a
      href='https://github.com/elteano/SdlOgl-Basic-EngLib'>here</a>. As this
      is a work in progress, I will be updating it as I have time to commit.
