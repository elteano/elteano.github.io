    <h3> CSE 167 at UCSD: </h3>
    <p> Final project, a collaboration with my peer Marco Mendez. I personally created
      the bloom effects and the water effects; my partner was responsible for the
      multi-textured model and (probably) the particle system. This was coded in
      C++ using OpenGL. </p>
    <p> The image on the left has bloom active, the image on the right does not. The
      bloom is most visible in the particle system emerging from the cannon and the
      clouds in the skybox. </p>
    <p> <img class='half' src='images/blooming.png' alt='Reflective water with bloom filter.'
      /> <img class='half' src='images/nobloom.png' alt='Reflective water without bloom filter.'
      /> </p>
    <p> The bloom effects are implemented using a Gaussian blur over the highlights of
      the scene. First, the items are rendered as normal; they are then filtered
      for the highlights, which are extracted into a separate framebuffer. The highlights
      are then flipped back and forth between two framebuffers, each time blurring
      either on the horizontal or vertical axes. The result is then added back to
      the base image to create the bloom effect. </p>
    <p> The water reflection is implemented by rendering the image twice, only rendering
      what is above the water. The first render uses the default camera; the second
      render uses the camera's position reflected beneath the water, so its new depth
      below the water is the same as its previous height above the water, and the
      angle is now tilted up to the same degree as it was tilted down. The second
      image is then transformed using a du/dv map to create the wave effect for things
      reflected from above the water (models, skybox, and the like). The two images
      are then painted onto the water quad, using the camera angle to determine how
      they are mixed in order to replicate the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations'>Fresnel effect</a>.

    <h3> CSE 190 at UCSD </h3>
    <p> There were three assignments for this course. For more information, follow the
      rabbit hole <a href='Ramamoorthi190'>here</a>. The final project was a combination
      of image processing and an artificial intelligence which attempted to replicate
      a given art style on an image. The user provides two sample images which establish
      the art style (one is unstyled, one is styled), as well as an image to be transformed,
      and the software attempts to replicate the given art style on the final image.
      This is based on the <i>Image Analogies</i> paper by Hertzman, et. al, found
      <a href='https://www.mrl.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-fullres.pdf'>here</a>.
      The input images were provided <a href='https://www.mrl.nyu.edu/projects/image-analogies/'>here</a>.
      This was coded in C++. </p>
    <p> Input images: <br/> <img class='half' src='Ramamoorthi190/a3/reflection_a.bmp'
        alt='Unstyled input image' /> <img class='half' src="Ramamoorthi190/a3/reflection_a'.bmp"
        alt='Styled input image' /> </p>
    <p> Target and output images: <br/> <img class='half' src='Ramamoorthi190/a3/shed.bmp'
      /> <img class='half' src='Ramamoorthi190/a3/new_paintshed.bmp' /> </p>

    <h3>Chopsticks</h3>
    <p> A client-server implementation of the game <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(game)'>Chopsticks</a>.
      Source code is available on <a href='https://github.com/elteano/Chopsticks'>GitHub</a>.
      It is written in an Object-Oriented fashion using D, and built with dub. Clients
      and servers may connect through IPv4 sockets or through Unix sockets, if available.
